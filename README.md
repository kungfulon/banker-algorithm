# Input data
First line: number of processes (p) and number of resources (r)
Next line: available resources
Next p line: maximum resources of processes
Next p line: allocated resources of processes

Requests:
First line: number of consecutive requests (n)
Next n line: process ID (starting from 0) and resources request
If n equals to 0 then the program ends
